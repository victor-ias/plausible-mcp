const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `This server queries Plausible Analytics (Stats API v2) for a site's traffic and conversions. All tools are read-only.

DATE RANGES (date_range, period_a, period_b):
- Relative: "7d", "30d", "12mo" (N days/months back), or "day", "month", "year", "all".
- Absolute: "YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD" (start,end), both inclusive.
- Dates must not be in the future. Today is the latest valid date; a range that ends after today returns a 400.

METRICS: visitors, visits, pageviews, views_per_visit, bounce_rate, visit_duration, events, scroll_depth, percentage, conversion_rate, group_conversion_rate, average_revenue, total_revenue, time_on_page.

DIMENSIONS (get_breakdown): event:page, event:goal, event:hostname, visit:entry_page, visit:exit_page, visit:source, visit:referrer, visit:channel, visit:utm_medium/source/campaign/content/term, visit:device, visit:browser(_version), visit:os(_version). Geography comes in two forms: visit:country/region/city return ISO/Geoname codes, while visit:country_name/region_name/city_name return human-readable names — prefer the *_name variants when presenting geography to users.

FILTERS: every query tool accepts property_filters, which — despite the name — filters by built-in dimensions as well as custom properties. Each entry is { "property", "operator", "values" }: property is a built-in dimension (e.g. "visit:channel", "visit:source", "visit:country_name", "event:page") or a bare custom property name (e.g. "plan" targets event:props:plan); operators are is, is_not, contains, contains_not (event:goal supports only is and contains); entries combine with AND. Do not target event:page or event:goal in property_filters while also passing the page/goal shortcut parameter — that call is rejected; use one or the other. Example — top pages for organic search traffic: get_breakdown with dimension "event:page" and property_filters [{ "property": "visit:channel", "operator": "is", "values": ["Organic Search"] }].

CUSTOM PROPERTIES: sites send their own custom event properties, addressed as "event:props:<name>". Break down by one in get_breakdown with dimension "event:props:<name>" (e.g. "event:props:plan"). Property names are site-specific; if you don't know them, break down by the property to see its values, or ask the user.

COMBINATION RULES:
- Session metrics bounce_rate, visit_duration, and views_per_visit cannot be combined with event:goal or event:props:<name> dimensions or goal filters. event:page is compatible, and event:hostname is compatible when paired with event:page. Use visitors, visits, pageviews, or events for custom-property breakdowns.
- For goal conversions, use get_conversions rather than passing session metrics alongside a goal.

SITE: site_id is a bare domain (e.g. "example.com"). If omitted, the server's default site is used; if there is no default, the call fails — ask the user which site to query.`;

const FEEDBACK_INSTRUCTIONS = `

FEEDBACK: If a tool result confuses you, an error message doesn't help you fix the call, or you cannot express the query you need, report it with send_feedback — it goes straight to the server's maintainers.`;
